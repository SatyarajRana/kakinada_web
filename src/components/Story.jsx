            Every time you shop from eSamudaay Kakinada you help the local
            community by paying neighbourhood businesses rather that big faraway
            companies. eSamudaay Kakinada charges a fixed fee from the stores
            and does not exploit them by eating into their business. Thatâ€™s how
            the money stays in the community!
